Summary
=======
Offline session register allows all users enrolled into a course to create, 
modify and delete offline sessions.
An offline session is defined as a period of time spent studying on a book or
doing any other activity which doesn't involve the generation of logs on Moodle.
Users can associate an offline session to a activity or a resource in the same course
in which the register is present. A description can be added for each offline session.

Extensions
==========
Offline session register can work together with Session Report.
Session report is a Moodle report plugin used to display sessions; when you install
both offline session register and session report, you will be able to display reports
for online and offline sessions together and download them.
